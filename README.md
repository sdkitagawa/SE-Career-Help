## What is this repository?
---------
A repository for the purpose of storing tips, tricks and useful knowledge for myself and maybe other Software Engineers.
</br>
</br>

## The best skill for a Software Engineer
---------
The best skill you can have as a Software Engineer it's the ability to focus on your studies, your work and turn off your mobile or put it on airplane mode while you study/work.
</br>
</br>

## Build a Project
---------
Don't be dependent on video tutorials, text tutorials, etc. The main point in studying programming is to create something! Build a project when you feel ready, when you have an idea, it doesn’t have to be a unique idea, it doesn’t have to be a brilliant idea, or even a revolutionary one, just needs to be a starting point for you to go deep into your studies and start building something, your own project, with your own code that does what you would like it to do.

## Skills you must have to be a true Software Engineer
---------
Well, here are some of my heartfelt recommendations on what I think is important for you to consider yourself what I like to call <strong>a true Software Engineer</strong>.

You will definitely need some knowledge that is fundamental to the field.

- Databases
- Compilers
- Data Structures
- Algorithms

There are also some stuff I considerate important like:

- You need to be highly and precisely analytical.
- You need to be able to understand your customers problem even when the communication between you and them is noisy.
- You must take responsibility for always being one step ahead of your customer when it comes to possible system improvements or new possible features.
- You should definitely discuss, talk, interview and do a lot of brainstorm processes to collect a nice list of requirements before you start writing even a single line of code.
- You need to be able to sequence and prioritize what needs to be done first and what can be done later.
- You definitely need to be able to decompose a big problem into a smaller problem.
- You need to know how to work well in a team! Remember, even if you're good on your own, a job well done and as a team can have amazing results!

## 5 Tips for Junior Software Engineers
-----

1. Take the time you feel you need to restructure and adapt your learning within the programming area, be free and feel good about it.
2. Don't be shy to comment your code while you are studying so it's clear to you what you're doing, things are made of levels and should scale that way.
3. Be the person who asks questions, ask lots of questions, gather information and take proper notes accurately and clearly in your note, be accurate and effective.
4. During your study sessions, only move on to a new topic when you feel comfortable with something. For example, if you are studying more about <strong>Data Structures</strong>, stick with it until you feel comfortable and confident about this topic, when you feel comfortable you move on to new content.
5. Don't be ashamed of searching for something or just asking someone else about a topic you're not that good! <strong>We are no encyclopedias!</strong>
