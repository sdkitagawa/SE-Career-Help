## What is this repository?

A repository for the purpose of storing tips, tricks and useful knowledge for myself and maybe other Software Engineers.
</br></br>

## The best skill for a Software Engineer

The best skill you can have as a Software Engineer it's the ability to focus on your studies, your work and turn off your mobile or put it on airplane mode while you study/work.
</br></br>

## Build a Project

Don't be dependent on video tutorials, text tutorials and etc. The main point in studying programming is to create something! Build a project when you feel ready, when you have an idea, it doesn't have to be a unique idea, it doesn't have to be a brilliant idea or even a revolutionary one just needs to be a starting point for you to go deep into your studies and start building something, your own project with your own code that does what you would like it to do.
</br></br>

## Skills you must have to be a true Software Engineer

Well, here are some of my heartfelt recommendations on what I think is important for you to consider yourself what I like to call <strong>a true Software Engineer</strong>.

You will definitely need some knowledge that is fundamental to the field.

- Databases
- Compilers
- Data Structures
- Algorithms

There are also some stuff I considerate important like:

- You need to be highly and precisely analytical.
- You need to be able to understand your customers problem even when the communication between you and them is noisy.
- You must take responsibility for always being one step ahead of your customer when it comes to possible system improvements or new possible features.
- You should definitely discuss, talk, interview and do a lot of brainstorm processes to collect a nice list of requirements before you start writing even a single line of code.
- You need to be able to sequence and prioritize what needs to be done first and what can be done later.
- You definitely need to be able to decompose a big problem into a smaller problem.
- You need to know how to work well in a team! Remember, even if you're good on your own, a job well done and as a team can have amazing results!

## 5 Tips for a Junior Software Engineers

1. Take the time you feel you need to restructure and adapt your learning within the programming area, be free and feel good about it.
2. Don't be shy to comment your code while you are studying so it's clear to you what you're doing, things are made of levels and should scale that way.
3. Be the person who asks questions, ask lots of questions, gather information and take proper notes accurately and clearly in your notes, be accurate and effective.
4. During your study sessions, only move on to a new topic when you feel comfortable with something. For example if you are studying more about <strong>Data Structures</strong>, stick with it by you feel comfortable and confident about this topic when you feel comfortable you move on to new content.
5. Don't be ashamed of searching for something or just asking someone else about a topic you're not that good! `We are no encyclopedias!`

## How to be a successful Software Engineer

To succeed in life you need to focus on what really matters and what really matters is what you wanna do. You should never care about what people think, say or how other people will judge you.

## The Best Searching Engine for Software Engineers

This time I bring to you guys the definitive tool for Software Engineers, Developers and such <strong>behold the [YouCode](https://you.com/code "Best searching engine for Developers, Software Engineers and Data Scientists")</strong>! Using this little bad boy you can let AI generate code based on your searched query, you can literally find code snippets with accessible copy and paste buttons.

<br><br>

## Best Software Engineer Tips

- Beware with programmers with that "God complex" who assume they have the solution to every problem or even a unique and miraculous code capable of doing what no other code has ever done.
- If you need to repeat any sequence of code more than ten times you should definitely think of ways to automate it.
- Make your code easy to read, like:
  - Use variable names that make sense.
  - Use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camel_case" alt="What is Camel Case Notation" target="blank">Camel Case Notation</a>.
  - Avoid unnecessary comment lines, make objective comments with things like a briefing of what your code does, credits, what data type your function returns and stuff like that, do that by using a header.
  - Don't comment line by line.
    - `In-line` commenting is one thing, the `line-by-line` comment makes the code look almost unreadable.
    - If you feel like it's necessary to document, use one single line at the top of your code or just use a `multi-line` comment.
  - Use your comments to warn developers about possible code breaks about some legacy code or stuff like that.
  - Never leave bad written and old code commented out in the middle of all the rest of your code.

## 4 Tips for the Work Environment as a Software Engineer

- Improve every day of your life at least about `0.27%` and so at the end of the year you will have an improvement of around `98%` of yourself, be always in constant evolution and avoid procrastination daily as a person and as a professional, read books, take courses, study frameworks, languages and build projects!
- Never rely on `90%` or more of your paycheck for a healthy life otherwise if you lose your job it will make losing your job even more painful, frustrating and such.
- Work is not about friendship, family, a goal or even a dream, work is about exchanging your time for money.
- Separate your work gear from your home gear.
  - For example, let's suppose you use the computer/laptop of your company for work. Always try to keep your documents, photos, or personal stuff on your personal computer/laptop, cloud systems, but never ever store your personal stuff on a work gear.
